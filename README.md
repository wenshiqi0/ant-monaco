# Electron Monaco Editor

This monaco is from vscode monaco-editor, but I add a tokenize2 api for this monaco and allow it to use Uint32Array directly.
Mostly it will be used with vscode-textmat under electron or nw.js.
And it can use vscode language extensions and theme extensions directly.

# Install

```bash
npm i

npm run rebuild
```

# Start

run example, you can drag file into editor.
```bash
npm run start
```

# build

```bash
npm run build
```

# watch

npm run dev
```
